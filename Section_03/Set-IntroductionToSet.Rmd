### Set theory


<h5> Fundamentals </h5>

* A Set is a collection of distinct and defined elements. 
* Sets are represented by using French braces $\{ \}$ with commas to separate the elements in a Set. 


* <a href= "https://youtube.com/watch?v=/faTNN9dN32w"> Set Theory - Membership Table Question  </a>






<h5> Cardinality </h5>

* The number of distinct elements in a finite set is called its cardinality.






### Set Specification



<h5> NOTATIONS FOR A SET: </h5>

A set can be represented by two methods:
1.	ROSTER METHOD
2.	BUILDER METHOD


<h5> ROSTER METHOD: </h5>

In this method the elements of a set are separated by commas and are enclosed within curly brackets { }. For example:

* A = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6} is a set of numbers.

* B = {Alex, Brian, Collenn, Darren, Elizabeth} is a set of names.

* C = {a, e, i, o, u} is a set of vowels.

* D = {apple, avocado, orange, banana, pear} is a set of fruits.

Listing the elements in this way is called Roster method. In this method, it is not necessary for the elements to be listed in a particular order. The elements of the set can be written just plainly, separated by commas and in any order.


<h5>  BUILDER METHOD </h5>


This method is also called Property method. In Builder method, a set is represented by stating all the properties which are satisfied by the elements of that particular set only.

For example:

If A is a set of elements less than 0, then in Builder method it will be written as

A = {x: x < 0}, this statement is read as "the set of all x such that x is less than 0"

If A is a set of all real numbers less than 7, then in Builder method it is written as A = {x   R: x < 7}

Similarly,

A = {2i: i is an integer} is a set of all even integers.

A = {x   R: x ? 2} is a set of all real numbers except 2.

A = {x   R: x > 3 and x < 7} is a set of real numbers greater than 3 but less than 7.

A = {x   Z: x > 6} is a set of integers greater than 6.

A = {x   Z: 2x + 1} is a set of all odd integers.

### Set theory

#### Definition of a set

A set is defined completely by its elements. Formally, sets X and Y are the same set if they have the same elements; that is, if every element of X is also an element of Y, and vice versa. For example, suppose we define:

\[ F = \{x | \mbox{(x is an integer)} \mbox{ and } 0 < x < 4)\}  \]

The equivalence of empty sets has a \textbf{\textit{metaphysical}} consequence for some theories of the metaphysics of properties that define the property of being x as simply the set of all x, then if the two properties are uninstantiated or coextensive they are equivalent - under this theory, because there are no unicorns and there are no pixies, the property of being a unicorn and being a pixie are the same - but if there were a unicorns and pixies, we could tell them apart. (See Universals for more on this.)

### Elements and subsets

The $\in$  sign indicates set membership. If x is an element (or "member") of a set X, we write $ \in X$; e.g. $3\in A$. (We may also say ``X contains x" and ``A contains 3")

A very important notion is that of a subset. X is a subset of Y, written $X \subseteq Y$ (sometimes simply as$X \subset Y$), if every element of X is also an element of Y. From before $C\subseteq A \subseteq E$.

#### Sets containing Sets


Sets can of course be elements of other sets; for example we can form the set $G = \{A,B,C,D,E\}$, whose five elements are the sets we considered earlier. Then, for instance, $A\in G$. (Note that this is very different from saying $A\subseteq G$)





### Number Sets

The font that the symbols are written in (i.e. $\mathbb{N}$, $\mathbb{R}$) is known as ***blackboard font***.

*  $\mathbb{N}$ Natural Numbers ($0,1,2,3$) 
(Not used in the CIS102 Syllabus)
*  $\mathbb{Z}$ Integers ($-3,-2,-1,0,1,2,3, \ldots$)
\begin{itemize}
* [$\ast$] $\mathbb{Z}^{+}$ Positive Integers
* [$\ast$] $\mathbb{Z}^{-}$ Negative Integers
\end{itemize}
*  $\mathbb{Q}$ Rational Numbers
*  $\mathbb{R}$ Real Numbers

#### Sets of Numbers

*  $\mathbb{Z}$ Set of all integers
*  $\mathbb{Q}$ Set of all rational numbers
*  $\mathbb{R}$ Set of all real numbers


*  $\mathbb{Z}^{+}$ Set of all positive integers
*  $\mathbb{Z}^{-}$ Set of all negative integers
*  $\mathbb{R}^{+}$ Set of all positive real numbers
*  $\mathbb{R}^{-}$ Set of all negative real numbers


#### Elements of a Set

*  Sets are comprised of members, which are often called {elements}. 
*  If a particular value ($k$) is an element of set $A$, then we would write this as
\[k \in A \]

*  If a single value $k$ is not an element of set $A$, then we write
\[k \notin A \]


#### Subsets
Given two sets $A$ and $B$, the set $A$ is a {subset} of set $B$ if every element of $A$ is also an element of $B$. 


We write this mathematically as
\[A \subseteq B \]



Sets are denoted with curly braces, even if they contain only one element.


#### Subsets

Suppose we have the set $A$ comprised of the following elements
\[ A =\{3,5,7,9\}\]
The value $5$ is an element of $A$
\[  5 \in A \]

The single element set $\{5\} $ is a subset of $A$.
\[ \{5\} \subseteq A\]

### Elements of a Set

A set is defined completely by its elements. Formally, sets X and Y are the same set if they have the same elements; that is, if every element of X is also an element of Y, and vice versa. For example, suppose we define:

\[ F = \{x | \mbox{(x is an integer)} \mbox{ and } 0 < x < 4)\}  \]
%Then F=A. The definition also makes it clear that {1,2,3} = (3,2,1} = {1,1,2,3,2}. Note also that if X and Y are both empty, then they are equal, justifying referring to "the" empty set.

The equivalence of empty sets has a {\textit{metaphysical}} consequence for some theories of the metaphysics of properties that define the property of being x as simply the set of all x, then if the two properties are uninstantiated or coextensive they are equivalent - under this theory, because there are no unicorns and there are no pixies, the property of being a unicorn and being a pixie are the same - but if there were a unicorns and pixies, we could tell them apart. 

For a set {\displaystyle A} having an element {\displaystyle x} , the following are all used synonymously:

*  {\displaystyle x} is a member of {\displaystyle A}
*  {\displaystyle x} is contained in {\displaystyle A}
*  {\displaystyle x} is included in {\displaystyle A}
*  {\displaystyle x} is an element of the set {\displaystyle A}
*  {\displaystyle A} contains {\displaystyle x}
*  {\displaystyle A} includes {\displaystyle x}


#### Elements and subsets

The $\in$  sign indicates set membership. If x is an element (or "member") of a set X, we write $ \in X$; e.g. $3\in A$. (We may also say ``X contains x" and ``A contains 3")

A very important notion is that of a subset. X is a subset of Y, written $X \subseteq Y$ (sometimes simply as$X \subset Y$), if every element of X is also an element of Y. From before $C\subseteq A \subseteq E$.

#### Proper Subset}
The term “proper subset” can be defined as “subset of but not equal to”. A Set X is a proper subset of set Y (Written as X⊂YX⊂Y) if every element of X is an element of set Y and $|X|<|Y|$.

#### Sets containing Sets


Sets can of course be elements of other sets; for example we can form the set $G = \{A,B,C,D,E\}$, whose five elements are the sets we considered earlier. Then, for instance, $A\in G$. (Note that this is very different from saying $A\subseteq G$)

%The tilde (~) is as usual used for negation; e.g. $\tilde(A\in B)$.


#### Equivalent Sets
If both of the following two statements are {true}, 
\[\mbox{1)  } A \subseteq B \]
\[\mbox{2)  } B \subseteq A \]

then $A$ and $B$ are {equivalent sets}.



#### Non-Comparable Sets}
If both of the following two statements are {false}, 
\[\mbox{1)  } A \subseteq B \]
\[\mbox{2)  } B \subseteq A \]

then $A$ and $B$ are said to be said to be {noncomparable sets}.

### Types of Sets
Sets can be classified into many types. Some of which are finite, infinite, subset, universal, proper, singleton set, etc.





#### The Universal Set and the Empty Set}

*  The first is the {\textit{universal set}}, typically denoted $U$. This set is all of the elements that we may choose from. 

This set may be different from one setting to the next. 

*  For example one universal set may be the set of all real numbers, denoted $\mathbb{R}$, whereas for another problem the universal set may be the whole numbers $\{0, 1, 2,\ldots\}$.

*  The other set that requires consideration is called the \textit{{empty set}}. 

The empty set is the unique set is the set with no elements. We write this as $\{ \}$ and denote this set by $\emptyset$.



#### Finite Set}
A set which contains a definite number of elements is called a finite set.

\subsubsection*{Example} \[S=\{x|x \in N and 70 >x>50\}\]

#### Infinite Set

A set which contains infinite number of elements is called an infinite set.

\subsubsection*{Example} 

\[S={x|x\in N  and x>10}\]
#### Subset
A set X is a subset of set Y (Written as $X \subseteq Y$) if every element of X is an element of set Y.

Example 1 − Let, $X={1,2,3,4,5,6}$ and Y={1,2}Y={1,2}. Here set Y is a subset of set X as all the elements of set Y is in set X. 

Hence, we can write $Y\subseteq X$.

Example 2 − Let, $X={1,2,3}$ and $Y={1,2,3}$. Here set Y is a subset (Not a proper subset) of set X as all the elements of set Y is in set X. Hence, we can write $Y\subseteqX$.



#### Example

 Let, $X={1,2,3,4,5,6}$ and $Y={1,2}$. Here set $Y \subset X$ since all elements in $Y$ are contained in $X$ too and $X$ has at least one element is more than set YY.

#### Universal Set


It is a collection of all elements in a particular context or application. All the sets in that context or application are essentially subsets of this universal set. Universal sets are represented as $U$.

#### Example

We may define $U$ as the set of all animals on earth. In this case, set of all mammals is a subset of $U$, set of all fishes is a subset of $U$, set of all insects is a subset of $U$, and so on.

#### Empty Set or Null Set
An empty set contains no elements. It is denoted by $\varnothing$. As the number of elements in an empty set is finite, empty set is a finite set. The cardinality of empty set or null set is zero.

#### Example

\[S={x|x\in N \mbox{ and }7<x<8}=\varnothing\]



Another set which has a special letter to denote it is the set containing no elements. This is called
the empty or null set and denoted by the symbol (D. 
Example 2.6 The set of integers m such that m2 = 5 is the empty set. 




#### Singleton Set or Unit Set

Singleton set or unit set contains only one element. A singleton set is denoted by {s}{s}.

#### Example

$S={x|x\in N, 7<x<9} = {8}$

#### Equal Set
If two sets contain the same elements they are said to be equal.

\subsubsection*{Example} 

If A={1,2,6}A={1,2,6} and B={6,1,2}B={6,1,2}, they are equal as every element of set A is an element of set B and every element of set B is an element of set A.

#### Equivalent Set
If the cardinalities of two sets are same, they are called equivalent sets.

#### Example

If A={1,2,6}A={1,2,6} and B={16,17,22}B={16,17,22}, they are equivalent as cardinality of A is equal to the cardinality of B. i.e. |A|=|B|=3|A|=|B|=3

#### Overlapping Set

Two sets that have at least one common element are called overlapping sets.

In case of overlapping sets −

\[n(A\cupB)=n(A)+n(B)−n(A\cap B)\]
\[n(A\cupB)=n(A−B)+n(B−A)+n(A\cap B)\]
\[n(A)=n(A−B)+n(A\cap B)\]
\[n(B)=n(B−A)+n(A\cap B)\]

#### Example

Let, $A={1,2,6}$ and $B={6,12,42}$. There is a common element ‘6’, hence these sets are overlapping sets.

### Disjoint Set

Two sets A and B are called disjoint sets if they do not have even one element in common. 
Therefore, disjoint sets have the following properties −

\[n(A\cap B)=\varnothing\]
\[n(A\cup B)=n(A)+n(B)\]
#### Example 

Let, A={1,2,6}A={1,2,6} and B={7,9,14}B={7,9,14}, there is not a single common element, hence these sets are overlapping sets.





#### Complement and universal set

The universal set (if it exists), usually denoted U, is a set of which everything conceivable is a member. In pure set theory, normally sets are the only objects considered (unlike here, where we have also considered numbers, colours and books, for example); in this case U would be the set of all sets. (Non-set objects, where they are allowed, are called 'urelemente' and are discussed below.)

In the presence of a universal set we can define X′, the complement of X, to be $U−X$. X′ contains everything in the universe apart from the elements of X. We could alternatively have defined it as

\[X′ = \{x | \tilde (x\in X)\}\]
and U as the complement of the empty set.

{Equal and Equivalent Sets}

<p>

Difference between equal sets and equivalent sets


*  Consider the sets {A} and {B}
\[ \boldsymbol{A} = \{ 1,2,3,4,5,6 \} \] 
\[ \boldsymbol{B} = \{1,2,3,4,5,6 \} \]

*  {A} and {B} are \textit{{equal}} sets because \textit{{all}} their
elements are precisely the \textit{{same}}.




#### Equal and Equivalent Sets


Difference between equal sets and equivalent sets


*  Consider the sets {C} and {D}
\[ \boldsymbol{C} = \{a,b,c,d,e,f\} \]  \[ \boldsymbol{D} = \{3,4,5,6,7,8\} \]

*  {C} and {D} are \textit{{equivalent}} sets
because the cardinality of both the sets is the same (i.e. 6.)
*  However {C} and {D} are not equal, as they are comprised of different elements.




*  Necessarily all equal sets are equivalent sets.
*  But are equivalent sets equal sets?

*  No, because equivalent sets are sets that have the \textit{{same}} cardinality but equal sets are sets that all
their elements are precisely the \textit{{same}}. 


#### Example:

*  {X}=\{p,q,r\} and {Y}=\{1,2,3\} are equivalent sets 
*  {E} =\{m,n,o,p\}
and {F}=\{m,n,o,p\} are equal and equivalent sets


### Ordered Lists 

If we consider "the songs on my iPod" as a familiar example of a set, then "a playlist on my iPod" is the corresponding example of an ordered list. Key properties of ordered lists include:

*  Order of elements in an ordered list is relevant.
*  Repetition of elements in an ordered list is relevant.


Explicit notion for writing ordered lists is similar to that for sets; however, we use parentheses instead of curly braces. For example:




*  (1,2) is an ordered list that is different than (2,1)
*  (1,1) is an ordered list that is different than (1)

From now on, expressions with parentheses "( , , , )" and expressions with curly braces "{ , , , }" have very distinct meanings!

The length of an ordered list is, intuitively speaking, just like the number of songs in a playlist. For example:



* The length of (1,10) is 2
* The length of (1,1,2,2) is 4
An ordered pair is an ordered list of length two. We will use ordered pairs very often in our study of the Web; we will use longer ordered lists less often. Also, we will never attempt to define the cardinality of an ordered list. Sets have cardinality. Ordered lists have length.



Any element in an ordered list can itself be an ordered list or a set. Any object in a set can be a set or an ordered list. 

For example:
{(1,2),(3,4)} is a set of two elements, each of which is an ordered pair. One of the elements of the set is (1,2) and the other element of the set is (3,4).
({1,2},{3},{2,4}) is an ordered list of sets. The first element of the list is the set {1,2}; the second element of the list is the set {3}; the third element of the list is the set {2,4}.

Power Sets {data-navmenu="Set Theory"}
====================================

Column {.tabset}
-------------------------------------------------------------


### Power Sets

#### Worked Example

Consider the set $Z$:
\[ Z = \{ a,b,c\}  \]

* [Q1] How many sets are in the power set of $Z$? 
* [Q2] Write out the power set of $Z$. 
* [Q3] How many elements are in each element set?


#### Solutions to Worked Example

* [Q1] There are 3 elements in $Z$. So there is $2^3 = 8$ element sets contained in the power set.

* [Q2] Write out the power set of $Z$.
\[ \mathcal{P}(Z) = \{ \{0\}, \{a\}, \{b\}, \{c\}, \{a,b\}, \{a,c\}, \{b,c\}, \{a,b,c\} \]

* [Q3]

* [*] One element set is the null set - i.e. containing no
elements 

* [$\bullet$] Three element sets have only elements 
* [$\bullet$] Three element sets have two elements 
* [$\bullet$] One element set contains all three elements 
* [$\bullet$] 1+3+3+1=8


#### Exercise
For the set $Y = \{u,v,w,x\}$ , answer the questions from the
previous exercise



#### Partitioning of a Set
Partition of a set, say S, is a collection of n disjoint subsets, say $P1,P2 \ldots Pn$  that satisfies the following three conditions :


*  $Pi$ does not contain the empty set.

 $[Pi \neq {\varnothing} for all 0<i\leq n]$
*  The union of the subsets must equal the entire original set.

\[P1 \cup P2 \cup \ldots \cup Pn=S\]
*  The Intersection of any two distinct sets is empty.

\[Pa \cap Pb={\varnothing}, for a\neq b where n\geq a,b\geq 0\]


#### Example

Let $S={a,b,c,d,e,f,g,h}$

*  One probable partitioning is ${a},{b,c,d},{e,f,g,h}$
*  Another probable partitioning is ${a,b},{c,d},{e,f,g,h}$




De Morgan's Laws {data-navmenu="Set Theory"}
====================================

Column {.tabset}
-------------------------------------------------------------

### De Morgan's Laws

\subsubsection{Set theory and Boolean algebra}
In set theory and Boolean algebra, De Morgan's Laws are often stated as "Union and intersection interchange under complementation" which can be formally expressed as:

\[\overline{A \cup B}\equiv\overline{A} \cap \overline{B}\]
\[\overline{A \cap B}\equiv\overline{A} \cup \overline{B}\]
where:

\item $\overline{A}$ is the negation of A, the overline being written above the terms to be negated
\item $\cap$ is the intersection operator (AND)
\item $\cup$ is the union operator (OR)


<hline>

In propositional logic and boolean algebra, \textbf{De Morgan's laws} are a pair of transformation rules that are both valid rules of inference. The rules allow the expression of conjunctions and disjunctions purely in terms of each other via negation.

The rules can be verbalized as:


* The negation of a conjunction is the disjunction of the negations.
* The negation of a disjunction is the conjunction of the negations.
or informally as:

\begin{center}
\textbf{``not (A and B)" is the same as "(not A) or (not B)"
}
\end{center}

and also,
\begin{center}
\textbf{``not (A or B)" is the same as "(not A) and (not B)"
}
\end{center}
The rules can be expressed in formal language with two propositions P and Q as:
\[ \neg(P\land Q)\iff(\neg P)\lor(\neg Q)\]
\[\neg(P\lor Q)\iff(\neg P)\land(\neg Q)\]
where:

* $\neg$ is the negation operator (NOT)
* $\wedge $ is the conjunction operator (AND)
* $\vee$ is the disjunction operator (OR)
* $\leftarrow \rightarrow$ is a metalogical symbol meaning "can be replaced in a logical proof with"
