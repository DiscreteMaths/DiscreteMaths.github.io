### Set theory


<h5> Fundamentals </h5>

* A Set is a collection of distinct and defined elements. 
* Sets are represented by using French braces $\{ \}$ with commas to separate the elements in a Set.

<h5> Cardinality </h5>

* The number of distinct elements in a finite set is called its cardinality.






### Set Specification



<h5> NOTATIONS FOR A SET: </h5>

A set can be represented by two methods:
1.	ROSTER METHOD
2.	BUILDER METHOD


<h5> ROSTER METHOD: </h5>

In this method the elements of a set are separated by commas and are enclosed within curly brackets { }. For example:

* A = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6} is a set of numbers.

* B = {Alex, Brian, Collenn, Darren, Elizabeth} is a set of names.

* C = {a, e, i, o, u} is a set of vowels.

* D = {apple, avocado, orange, banana, pear} is a set of fruits.

Listing the elements in this way is called Roster method. In this method, it is not necessary for the elements to be listed in a particular order. The elements of the set can be written just plainly, separated by commas and in any order.


<h5>  BUILDER METHOD </h5>


This method is also called Property method. In Builder method, a set is represented by stating all the properties which are satisfied by the elements of that particular set only.

For example:

If A is a set of elements less than 0, then in Builder method it will be written as

A = {x: x < 0}, this statement is read as "the set of all x such that x is less than 0"

If A is a set of all real numbers less than 7, then in Builder method it is written as A = {x   R: x < 7}

Similarly,

A = {2i: i is an integer} is a set of all even integers.

A = {x   R: x ? 2} is a set of all real numbers except 2.

A = {x   R: x > 3 and x < 7} is a set of real numbers greater than 3 but less than 7.

A = {x   Z: x > 6} is a set of integers greater than 6.

A = {x   Z: 2x + 1} is a set of all odd integers.

### Set theory

#### Definition of a set

A set is defined completely by its elements. Formally, sets X and Y are the same set if they have the same elements; that is, if every element of X is also an element of Y, and vice versa. For example, suppose we define:

\[ F = \{x | \mbox{(x is an integer)} \mbox{ and } 0 < x < 4)\}  \]

The equivalence of empty sets has a \textbf{\textit{metaphysical}} consequence for some theories of the metaphysics of properties that define the property of being x as simply the set of all x, then if the two properties are uninstantiated or coextensive they are equivalent - under this theory, because there are no unicorns and there are no pixies, the property of being a unicorn and being a pixie are the same - but if there were a unicorns and pixies, we could tell them apart. (See Universals for more on this.)

### Elements and subsets

The $\in$  sign indicates set membership. If x is an element (or "member") of a set X, we write $ \in X$; e.g. $3\in A$. (We may also say ``X contains x" and ``A contains 3")

A very important notion is that of a subset. X is a subset of Y, written $X \subseteq Y$ (sometimes simply as$X \subset Y$), if every element of X is also an element of Y. From before $C\subseteq A \subseteq E$.

#### Sets containing Sets


Sets can of course be elements of other sets; for example we can form the set $G = \{A,B,C,D,E\}$, whose five elements are the sets we considered earlier. Then, for instance, $A\in G$. (Note that this is very different from saying $A\subseteq G$)





### Number Sets

The font that the symbols are written in (i.e. $\mathbb{N}$, $\mathbb{R}$) is known as ***blackboard font***.

*  $\mathbb{N}$ Natural Numbers ($0,1,2,3$) 
(Not used in the CIS102 Syllabus)
*  $\mathbb{Z}$ Integers ($-3,-2,-1,0,1,2,3, \ldots$)
\begin{itemize}
* [$\ast$] $\mathbb{Z}^{+}$ Positive Integers
* [$\ast$] $\mathbb{Z}^{-}$ Negative Integers
\end{itemize}
*  $\mathbb{Q}$ Rational Numbers
*  $\mathbb{R}$ Real Numbers

#### Sets of Numbers

*  $\mathbb{Z}$ Set of all integers
*  $\mathbb{Q}$ Set of all rational numbers
*  $\mathbb{R}$ Set of all real numbers


*  $\mathbb{Z}^{+}$ Set of all positive integers
*  $\mathbb{Z}^{-}$ Set of all negative integers
*  $\mathbb{R}^{+}$ Set of all positive real numbers
*  $\mathbb{R}^{-}$ Set of all negative real numbers


#### Elements of a Set

*  Sets are comprised of members, which are often called {elements}. 
*  If a particular value ($k$) is an element of set $A$, then we would write this as
\[k \in A \]

*  If a single value $k$ is not an element of set $A$, then we write
\[k \notin A \]


#### Subsets
Given two sets $A$ and $B$, the set $A$ is a {subset} of set $B$ if every element of $A$ is also an element of $B$. 


We write this mathematically as
\[A \subseteq B \]



Sets are denoted with curly braces, even if they contain only one element.


#### Subsets

Suppose we have the set $A$ comprised of the following elements
\[ A =\{3,5,7,9\}\]
The value $5$ is an element of $A$
\[  5 \in A \]

The single element set $\{5\} $ is a subset of $A$.
\[ \{5\} \subseteq A\]

### Elements of a Set

A set is defined completely by its elements. Formally, sets X and Y are the same set if they have the same elements; that is, if every element of X is also an element of Y, and vice versa. For example, suppose we define:

\[ F = \{x | \mbox{(x is an integer)} \mbox{ and } 0 < x < 4)\}  \]
%Then F=A. The definition also makes it clear that {1,2,3} = (3,2,1} = {1,1,2,3,2}. Note also that if X and Y are both empty, then they are equal, justifying referring to "the" empty set.

The equivalence of empty sets has a {\textit{metaphysical}} consequence for some theories of the metaphysics of properties that define the property of being x as simply the set of all x, then if the two properties are uninstantiated or coextensive they are equivalent - under this theory, because there are no unicorns and there are no pixies, the property of being a unicorn and being a pixie are the same - but if there were a unicorns and pixies, we could tell them apart. 

For a set {\displaystyle A} having an element {\displaystyle x} , the following are all used synonymously:

*  {\displaystyle x} is a member of {\displaystyle A}
*  {\displaystyle x} is contained in {\displaystyle A}
*  {\displaystyle x} is included in {\displaystyle A}
*  {\displaystyle x} is an element of the set {\displaystyle A}
*  {\displaystyle A} contains {\displaystyle x}
*  {\displaystyle A} includes {\displaystyle x}


#### Elements and subsets

The $\in$  sign indicates set membership. If x is an element (or "member") of a set X, we write $ \in X$; e.g. $3\in A$. (We may also say ``X contains x" and ``A contains 3")

A very important notion is that of a subset. X is a subset of Y, written $X \subseteq Y$ (sometimes simply as$X \subset Y$), if every element of X is also an element of Y. From before $C\subseteq A \subseteq E$.

#### Proper Subset}
The term “proper subset” can be defined as “subset of but not equal to”. A Set X is a proper subset of set Y (Written as X⊂YX⊂Y) if every element of X is an element of set Y and $|X|<|Y|$.

#### Sets containing Sets


Sets can of course be elements of other sets; for example we can form the set $G = \{A,B,C,D,E\}$, whose five elements are the sets we considered earlier. Then, for instance, $A\in G$. (Note that this is very different from saying $A\subseteq G$)

%The tilde (~) is as usual used for negation; e.g. $\tilde(A\in B)$.


#### Equivalent Sets
If both of the following two statements are {true}, 
\[\mbox{1)  } A \subseteq B \]
\[\mbox{2)  } B \subseteq A \]

then $A$ and $B$ are {equivalent sets}.



#### Non-Comparable Sets}
If both of the following two statements are {false}, 
\[\mbox{1)  } A \subseteq B \]
\[\mbox{2)  } B \subseteq A \]

then $A$ and $B$ are said to be said to be {noncomparable sets}.
