### Proper Subset
**Proper Subset**

In set theory, a proper subset of a set A is a subset of A that is not equal to A itself. In other words, it contains some but not all of the elements of A.

**Key Points:**

* **Symbol:** ⊂ (or ⊊) is used to denote a proper subset.
* **Definition:** If A and B are sets, A is a proper subset of B if:
    * Every element of A is also an element of B (A ⊆ B)
    * There exists at least one element in B that is not in A.

**Example:**

* Let A = {1, 2, 3}
    * {1, 2} is a proper subset of A because it contains some but not all of A's elements.
    * {1, 2, 3} is a subset of A, but it is not a proper subset because it is equal to A.

**Key Differences between Subset and Proper Subset:**

* **Subset (⊆):** Includes the possibility that the two sets are equal.
* **Proper Subset (⊂ or ⊊):** Excludes the possibility that the two sets are equal.

**In essence:**

* A proper subset is like a smaller version of the original set, missing at least one element.
