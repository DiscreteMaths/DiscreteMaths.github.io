### Set Theory Operations

*  The Universal Set $\mathcal{U}$

|| Operation | Notation |
|--------------------:|----------:|----------:| --------------------:| 
|| Union| $A \cup B$ | ||
||Intersection |||
|| Set Difference |||
||  Relative Difference |||



### Intersection


*  Intersection of two sets describes the elements that are members of both the specified Sets

*  The intersection is denoted $\mathcal{A\cap B}$ 
\[ \mathcal{A\cap B} = \{2\}\]

*  only one element is a member of both A and B.



### Relative Difference

<h4> Relative Difference</h4>

$ A \oplus B$



#### Set difference

The difference X minus Y, written X-Y or $X\|Y$, contains all those elements in X that are not also in Y. For example, E-A contains all integers greater than 3. 
A-B is just A; red, green and blue were not elements of A, so no difference is made by excluding them.


#### Set Difference


*  The Set Difference of A with regard to B are list of elements of A not contained by B.

*  The complements are denoted $\mathcal{A-B}$ and $\mathcal{B-A}$
\[ \mathcal{A-B} = \{1,3,5,7\}, \]

\[ \mathcal{B-A} = \{4,6,8\}, \]



#### Set Difference/ Relative Complement
The set difference of sets A and B (denoted by $Aâ€“B$) is the set of elements which are only in A but not in B. Hence, $A-B={x|x \in A AND x \notin B}$.
Example: If $A={10,11,12,13}$ and $B={13,14,15}$, then $(A-B)={10,11,12}$ and $(B-A)={14,15}$. Here, we can see (A-B)?(B-A)(A-B)?(B-A) Set Difference

### Power set

<h4> Power Set </h4>

The power set of X, $P(X)$, is the set whose elements are all the subsets of X. Thus \[P(A) = \{ \{\}, \{1\}, \{2\}, \{3\}, \{1,2\}, \{1,3\}, \{2,3\}, \{1,2,3\}\}\]. The power set of the empty set $P(\{\})$ = $\{\{\}\}$. 

Note that in both cases the cardinality of the power set is strictly greater than that of base set: No one-to-one correspondence exists between the set and its power set. 



#### Power Set
Power set of a set S is the set of all subsets of S including the empty set. The cardinality of a power set of a set S of cardinality n is $2^n$. Power set is denoted as $P(S)$.

#### Example 

For a set $S={a,b,c,d}$ let us calculate the subsets 


*  Subsets with 0 elements : $\{ \varnothing\}$ (the empty set)
*  Subsets with 1 element : {a},{b},{c},{d}
*  Subsets with 2 elements : {a,b},{a,c},{a,d},{b,c},{b,d},{c,d}
*  Subsets with 3 elements : {a,b,c},{a,b,d},{a,c,d},{b,c,d}
*  Subsets with 4 elements : {a,b,c,d}


Hence, \[P(S)=
{{\varnothing},{a},{b},{c},{d},{a,b},{a,c},{a,d},{b,c},{b,d},{c,d},{a,b,c},{a,b,d},{a,c,d},{b,c,d},{a,b,c,d}}\]
\[|P(S)|=2^4=16\]
Note: The power set of an empty set is also an empty set.

$|P({\varnothing})|=2^0=1$
 

#### Power set

The power set of X, $P(X)$, is the set whose elements are all the subsets of X. Thus \[P(A) = \{ \{\}, \{1\}, \{2\}, \{3\}, \{1,2\}, \{1,3\}, \{2,3\}, \{1,2,3\}\}.\] The power set of the empty set $P(\{\})$ = $\{\{\}\}$. 
<p>
Note that in both cases the cardinality of the power set is strictly greater than that of base set: No one-to-one correspondence exists between the set and its power set. 

#### Power Sets



*  Consider the set A where $ A = \{w,x,y,z\}$
*  There are 4 elements in set A.

*  The power set of A contains 16 element data sets.

 \[  \mathcal{P}(A) = \{\{ x \}, \{ y \} \{\{ x,y \}, \{ w,y \}\}  \]

*  (i.e. 1 null set, 4 single element sets, 6 two -elements sets, 4 three element set and 1 four element set.)





### Cartesian Product

<h4>Cartesian Product</h4>

* In set theory, the Cartesian product of two sets A and B, denoted $A \times B$, is the set of all ordered pairs (a, b) where $a$ is in $A$ and $b$ is in $B$.
* Cartesian Product is the multiplication of two sets to form the set of all ordered pairs.
* The first element of the ordered pair belong to first set and second pair belong the second set.
