### Set Theory Operations

*  The Universal Set $\mathcal{U}$


\[
\begin{array}{|l|c|}
Operation & Notation \\ \hline
Union & $A \cup B$ \\ \hline
Intersection & \\ \hline
Set Difference & \\ \hline
Relative Difference & \\ \hline
\end{array}
\]


### Intersection


*  Intersection of two sets describes the elements that are members of both the specified Sets

*  The intersection is denoted $\mathcal{A\cap B}$ 
\[ \mathcal{A\cap B} = \{2\}\]

*  only one element is a member of both A and B.



### Relative Difference

<h4> Relative Difference</h4>

$ A \oplus B$



#### Set difference

* The difference ***X minus Y***, written X-Y or $X\|Y$, contains all those elements in X that are not also in Y. 
* For example, $E-A$ contains all integers greater than 3. 
A-B is just A; red, green and blue were not elements of A, so no difference is made by excluding them.


#### Set Difference


*  The Set Difference of A with regard to B are list of elements of A not contained by B.

*  The complements are denoted $\mathcal{A-B}$ and $\mathcal{B-A}$
\[ \mathcal{A-B} = \{1,3,5,7\}, \]

\[ \mathcal{B-A} = \{4,6,8\}, \]



#### Set Difference/ Relative Complement
The set difference of sets A and B (denoted by $Aâ€“B$) is the set of elements which are only in A but not in B. Hence, $A-B={x|x \in A AND x \notin B}$.
Example: If $A={10,11,12,13}$ and $B={13,14,15}$, then $(A-B)={10,11,12}$ and $(B-A)={14,15}$. Here, we can see (A-B)?(B-A)(A-B)?(B-A) Set Difference

### Intersection

#### Intersection 

* Intersection of two sets describes the elements that are members of both the specified Sets

* The intersection is denoted $\mathcal{A\cap B}$ 
\[ \mathcal{A\cap B} = \{2\}\]

* only one element is a member of both A and B.

### Set Difference 

#### Set Difference


* The Set Difference of A with regard to B are list of elements of A not contained by B.

* The complements are denoted $\mathcal{A-B}$ and $\mathcal{B-A}$
\[ \mathcal{A-B} = \{1,3,5,7\}, \]

\[ \mathcal{B-A} = \{4,6,8\}, \]




### Cartesian Product

<h4>Cartesian Product</h4>

* In set theory, the Cartesian product of two sets A and B, denoted $A \times B$, is the set of all ordered pairs (a, b) where $a$ is in $A$ and $b$ is in $B$.
* Cartesian Product is the multiplication of two sets to form the set of all ordered pairs.
* The first element of the ordered pair belong to first set and second pair belong the second set. 



### *{Question 2}
Describe the following set by the rules of inclusion method.

Describe the following set by the listing method
the set of positive multiples of 3 which are less than 20.

Let A and B be subsets of univerisal set U

Use the membership rule to prove that

\[(A^\prime  \cap B)^\prime = A \cup B^\prime\]

shade the region corresponding to this set on a Venn Diagram

Given the universal set $\mathcal{U} = {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9}$
and the subsets $A=\{1,3,5,7\}$
$B = \{6,7,8,9\}$
list the set $A^\prime \cap B)^\prime$ 




[(i)] $\{5,8\}$
[(ii)] $\{1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9\}$
