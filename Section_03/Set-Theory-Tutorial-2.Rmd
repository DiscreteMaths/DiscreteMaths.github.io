### Set Theory - Worksheet 2





### Set Specification




#### *{2008  Zone A question 2a}
$B = \{3n-1 :n \in Z^{+} \}$
Describe the set B using the listing method


* Let $n=1$. Consequently $3(1)-1 =2$
* Let $n=2$. Likewise $3(2)-1 =5$
* Let $n=3$. $3(3)-1 = 8 $
* The repeated differences are 3. The next few values are 11, 14 and 17
* So by the listing method $B= \{2,5,8,11,14,17,\ldots\}$


$A = \{3,5,7,9,ldots \}$

------------------------------------------

Describe the set A using the rules of inclusion method


* The repeated differences are 2.
* We can say the rule has the form $2n+k$
* For the first value n=1. Therefore $2+k=3$
* Checking this , for the second value , n=2. Therefore $4+k=5$
* Clearly k = 1.
* $A = \{2n+1 :n \in Z^{+} \}$
* So by the listing method $B= \{2,5,8,11,14,17,\ldots\}$

### Complements

--------------------------------------
#### *{Worked Example}

Suppose that the Universal Set $\mathcal{U}$ is the set of integers from 1 to 9.
\[ \mathcal{U} = \{1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9\}, \]

and that the set $\mathcal{A}$ contains the prime numbers between 1 to 9 inclusive.

\[ \mathcal{A} = \{1,2,3,5,7\}, \]

and that the set $\mathcal{B}$ contains the even numbers between 1 to 9 inclusive.

\[ \mathcal{B} = \{2,4,6,8\}. \]



--------------------------------------------------------
#### Complements


* The Complements of A and B are the elements of the universal set not contained in A and B.

* The complements are denoted $\mathcal{A}^{\prime}$ and $\mathcal{B}^{\prime}$
\[ \mathcal{A}^{\prime} = \{4,6,8,9\}, \]
\[ \mathcal{B}^{\prime} = \{1,3,5,7,9\}, \]

### De Morgans Laws

* Let A, B be subsets of the universal set $\mathcal{U}$.

Use membership tables to prove De Morgan's Laws.
