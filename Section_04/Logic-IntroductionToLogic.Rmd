### Logical Operations

* $\neg p$ the negation of proposition $p$.
* $p \wedge q$ Both propositions p and q are simultaneously true (Logical State AND)
* $p \vee q $ One of the propositions is true, or both (Logical State : OR)
* $p \otimes q$ Only one of the propositions is true (Logical State : exclusive OR (i.e XOR)

### logical implication


#### logical implication

%- http://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/logical-implication

Logical implication is a type of relationship between two statements or sentences. The relation translates verbally into "logically implies" or "if/then" and is symbolized by a double-lined arrow pointing toward the right ( $\rightarrow$). If A and B represent statements, then $A\rightarrow B$ means "A implies B" or "If A, then B." The word "implies" is used in the strongest possible sense.


As an example of logical implication, suppose the sentences A and B are assigned as follows:

* A = The sky is overcast.
* B = The sun is not visible.

In this instance, A B is a true statement (assuming we are at the surface of the earth, below the cloud layer.) However, the statement B A is not necessarily true; it might be a clear night. Logical implication does not work both ways. However, the sense of logical implication is reversed if both statements are negated. That is,

$$(A \rightarrow B)  \equiv (-B \rightarrow -A)$$

Using the above sentences as examples, we can say that if the sun is visible, then the sky is not overcast. This is always true. In fact, the two statements A B and -B -A are logically equivalent.
