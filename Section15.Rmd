<h3>Group Theory</h3>

<ul>
	<li>Group theory studies the algebraic structures known as <strong>groups</strong>.</li>
	<li>The concept of a group is central to abstract algebra: other well-known algebraic structures, such as rings, fields, and vector spaces, can all be seen as groups endowed with additional operations and axioms.</li>
	<li>Groups recur throughout mathematics, and the methods of group theory have influenced many parts of algebra.</li>
	<li>Linear algebraic groups and Lie groups are two branches of group theory that have experienced advances and have become subject areas in their own right.</li>
</ul>
