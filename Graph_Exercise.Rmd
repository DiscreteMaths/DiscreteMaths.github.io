Sure! Let's create a graph with 5 vertices where each vertex has a degree of 2 or more. Here is an example of such a graph:

Vertices: \( A, B, C, D, E \)
Edges: 
- \( A \) connected to \( B \) and \( C \)
- \( B \) connected to \( A, C, \) and \( D \)
- \( C \) connected to \( A, B, \) and \( E \)
- \( D \) connected to \( B \) and \( E \)
- \( E \) connected to \( C \) and \( D \)

### Adjacency Matrix

The adjacency matrix \( \mathbf{A} \) for this graph is:
\[
\begin{array}{c|ccccc}
  & A & B & C & D & E \\
\hline
A & 0 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\
B & 1 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 0 \\
C & 1 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\
D & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\
E & 0 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 0 \\
\end{array}
$$

- Each row and column represent the vertices \( A, B, C, D, \) and \( E \).
- The cell \( \mathbf{A}[i][j] \) is 1 if there is an edge between vertices \( i \) and \( j \), and 0 otherwise.

In this adjacency matrix, each vertex has at least 2 edges, ensuring each has a degree of 2 or more.

If you have any further questions or need another example, feel free to ask!
\begin{enumerate}
*  How many edges are in the spanning tree $T$ ?
*  What is the sum of the degree sequence of $T$?
*  Write down all the possible degree sequences for the spanning tree $T$.
\end{enumerate}

### Spanning Tree Properties

Let's go through each question one by one.

#### 1. How many edges are in the spanning tree \( T \) ?

In a spanning tree with \( n \) vertices, the number of edges is always \( n - 1 \). This is a fundamental property of spanning trees, as they are acyclic and connected graphs.

If \( T \) has \( n \) vertices, then the number of edges in \( T \) is:
\[ \text{Number of edges} = n - 1 $$

#### 2. What is the sum of the degree sequence of \( T \)?

The sum of the degrees of all the vertices in any graph is twice the number of edges, according to the Handshaking Lemma. Since a spanning tree with \( n \) vertices has \( n - 1 \) edges, the sum of the degree sequence is:
\[ \text{Sum of the degree sequence} = 2(n - 1) $$

#### 3. Write down all the possible degree sequences for the spanning tree \( T \).

The degree sequence of a spanning tree \( T \) is a list of degrees of its vertices. Since the sum of the degrees of the vertices is \( 2(n - 1) \), the degree sequence must add up to this number. Let's consider some examples with different \( n \) values:

- **For \( n = 4 \):**
  \[ \text{Number of edges} = 4 - 1 = 3 $$
  \[ \text{Sum of the degree sequence} = 2(3) = 6 $$

  Possible degree sequences could be:
  - \( (3, 1, 1, 1) \)
  - \( (2, 2, 1, 1) \)

- **For \( n = 5 \):**
  \[ \text{Number of edges} = 5 - 1 = 4 $$
  \[ \text{Sum of the degree sequence} = 2(4) = 8 $$

  Possible degree sequences could be:
  - \( (4, 1, 1, 1, 1) \)
  - \( (3, 2, 1, 1, 1) \)
  - \( (2, 2, 2, 1, 1) \)

These sequences list the degrees of each vertex in \( T \) such that the sum of the degrees is \( 2(n - 1) \) and they are connected in a tree structure. These examples can be extended to any number of vertices \( n \).
