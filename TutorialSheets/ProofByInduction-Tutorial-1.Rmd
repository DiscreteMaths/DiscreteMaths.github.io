\begin{enumerate}
<hline>  Let the summation $s_n$ be defined as follows:
\[s_n = 1 + 3 + 5 + \ldots + (2n - 1) \qquad \mbox{for n }\in \mathbb{Z}^{+}\]

Use the method of induction to prove that $s_n = n^2$ for all $n \geq 1$.

<hline>  Prove that $9^{n} - 1$ is a multiple of 8 for all $n \in \mathbb{N}.$
<hline>  Prove that 3 is a factor of $4^{n} - 1$, for $n \in \mathbb{N}.$
<hline>  Prove that $3\times 2^{n} - 1$ is divisible by 8 for $n \in \mathbb{N}.$
<hline>  Show that $8^{n} + 6$ is divisible by 14, for $n \in \mathbb{N}.$
<hline>  Prove that $3\times 2^{n} + 7$ is divisible by 8, for $n \in \mathbb{N}.$
<hline>  Show that $n^3 + 3n^2 - 10n$ is divisible by 3. 

<hline>  Show that, for all positive integers n, $9^{n} + 7$ is divisible by 8. 
<hline>   Show that $2\times 3^{n} + 3$ is divisible by 7, for all $n \in \mathbb{N}.$
<hline>   Prove that $2^{n} > n^2$, for $n > 5$, with $n \in \mathbb{N}.$
<hline>  Prove by induction, or otherwise, that $(1 + x)^{n} >1 - nx$, x and $n \in \mathbb{N}$. 
% <hline>  Prove by induction that $1.1! + 2.2! 3.3! 1 - \ldots + n.n! = + - $

A sequence is defined by the recurrence relations
\[x_{n+2}  = 3x_{n+1} - 2x_n\]
with initial terms $x_1 = 1$ and $x_2=3$.
