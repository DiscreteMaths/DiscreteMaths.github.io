[(a)] What properties must a graph satisfy in order for it to be a tree? [2 Marks]
[(b)] Design a balanced binary search tree for an ordered list of 15 records.
Label the records $1,2, \ldots , 15$ in your tree. [4 Marks]

[(c)] A binary search tree is designed to store an ordered list of 50000 records,
numbered $1,2,3\ldots 50000$ at its internal nodes.

[(i)] Draw levels 0, 1 and 2 of this tree, showing which number record is stored
at the root and at each of the nodes at level 1 and 2, making it clear
which records are at each level.
[(ii)] What is the maximum number of comparisons that would have to be
made in order to locate an existing record from the list of 50000?
