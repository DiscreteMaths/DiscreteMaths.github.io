### Work Sheet 1


#### Question 1

a.  Let G be a graph and let v be a vertex of G. Say what is meant by the degree
of v. 
b.  A graph is called k-regular if each of its vertices has degree k. Construct an
example of:

 i.   a 2-regular graph with 5 vertices, 
 ii.  a 3-regular graph with 6 vertices. 

c. State, without proving, a result connecting the degrees of the vertices of
a graph G with the number of its edges.
d. Use the result in part (c) to find the number of edges of a 3-regular graph with 10
vertices
d. Explain why it is not possible to construct a 3-regular graph with 9 vertices. 



---------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### Question 2



Draw the graph \textbf{G}, which has the vertices $v_1$,$v_2$,$v_3$,$\ldots$,$v_7$, and the adjacency list:



 [$v_1$]: $v_2$,$v_4$
 [$v_2$]: $v_1$,$v_3$
 [$v_3$]: $v_2$,$v_4$
 [$v_4$]: $v_1$,$v_3$,$v_5$
 [$v_5$]: $v_4$,$v_6$
 [$v_6$]: $v_5$,$v_7$
 [$v_7$]: $v_5$,$v_6$


---------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### Question 3

Given the following definitions for simple, connected graphs:

* $K_n$ is a graph on $n$ vertices where each pair of vertices is connected by an edge;
* $C_n$ is the graph with vertices $v_1, v_2, v_3, \dots, v_n$ and edges $\{v_1,v_2\}, \{v_2,v_3\}, \dots\{v_n, v_1\}$;
* $W_n$ is the graph obtained from $C_n$ by adding an extra vertex,$v_{n+1}$, and edges
from this to each of the original vertices in $C_n$.

Draw $K_4$, $C_4$, and $W_4$. 


---------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### Question 4

a. A simple, connected graph has 7 vertices, all having the same degree d.
State the possible values of d and for each value also give the number of edges
in the corresponding graph.
b.  Another simple, connected graph has 6 vertices, all having the same degree, n. 
Draw such a graph when n = 3 and state the other possible values of n.
