### Natural, Rational and Real Numbers

* $\mathbb{N}$ : natural numbers (or positive integers) $\{1,2,3,\ldots\}$
* $\mathbb{Z}$ : integers $\{-3,-2,-1,0,1,2,3,\ldots\}$
\begin{itemize}
* (The letter $\mathbb{Z}$ comes from the word \emph{Zahlen} which means ``numbers" in German.)

* $\mathbb{Q}$ : rational numbers
* $\mathbb{R}$ : real numbers
* $\mathbb{N} \subseteq \mathbb{Z } \subseteq \mathbb{Q} \subseteq \mathbb{R}$

* (All natural numbers are integers. All integers are rational numbers. All rational numbers are real numbers.)

### Significant Digits
 
* There are three rules on determining how many significant figures are in a number: Non-zero digits are always significant. 
* Any zeros between two significant digits are significant. 
* A final zero or trailing zeros in the decimal portion ONLY are significant.




### Floating Point Notation

* In computing, floating point describes a method of  representing an approximation of a real number in a 
way that can support a wide range of values. 


* The numbers are, in general, represented approximately to a fixed number of significant digits (the mantissa) and scaled using an exponent. 

* In essence, computers are integer machines and are capable of representing real numbers only by using complex codes. The most popular code for representing real numbers is called the IEEE Floating-Point Standard .
The term floating point is derived from the fact that there is no fixed number of digits before and after the decimal point; that is, the decimal point can float. 

* There are also representations in 
which the number of digits before and after the decimal point is set, called fixed-point representations. 

* In general, floating-point representations are slower and less accurate than fixed-point representations, but they can handle a larger range of numbers.

### Real and Irrational Numbers

In mathematics, an irrational number is a real number that cannot be expressed as a ratio of integers, i.e. as a fraction. 
Therefore, irrational numbers, when written as decimal numbers, do not terminate, nor do they repeat.



#### Irrational Numbers

An irrational number cannot be expressed as a ratio between two numbers and it cannot be written as a simple fraction because there is not a finite number of numbers when written as a decimal. Instead, the numbers in the decimal would go on forever, without repeating.



#### Rational and Irrational Numbers
You can tell if it is Rational or Irrational by trying to write the number as a simple fraction.

*  1.5 is rational, because it can be written as the ratio 3/2
*  7 is rational, because it can be written as the ratio 7/1
*  0.333... (3 repeating) is also rational, because it can be written as the ratio 1/3

### Fractional Numbers
<div class="tag-box tag-box-v1 margin-bottom-20">
	<p><span class="dropcap">I</span>f we want a definition, we can start by saying that fractional numbers are numbers that represent one or more parts of a unit that has been divided in equal parts.</p>
	<img class="img-responsive" style="margin:10px auto;" src="images/faq/fraction.png" alt="fractional number" />
	<p>The fractional numbers are figured out by two whole numbers (<b>the fraction terms</b>) that are separated by a horizontal line (<b>the fraction line</b>). The number above the line (<b>the numerator</b>) can be every whole number and the number below the line (<b>the denominator</b>) should be different from zero. Here are some examples of some kinds of fractions:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Proper Fraction: the number is inferior to the denominator, for instance `3/4` ;</li>
		<li>Improper fraction: the numerator is superior to the denominator, for instance `9/2` ;</li>
		<li>Mixed Fraction or Mixed Numeral:  it is composed of a whole part and a fractional one, for instance `2 1/3` ;</li>
		<li>Equivalent  Fractions: fractions that keep on the same proportion of another fraction, for instance: `5/2 = 10/4` ;</li>
		<li>Irreducible Fraction: it cannot be simplified, for instance:  `4/3` ;</li>
		<li>Decimal Fraction: the denominator is a power whose base is  10 (10,100,1000,...), for instance `8/100` ;</li>
	</ul>
	<h2>Is every number written as a fraction a fractional number?</h2>
	<p>It may seem weird, but the answer is <b>No</b>. First of all because the definition tells us that fractional numbers are numbers that represent one or more parts of the whole. So, for instance, the number `10/2`, which is written as a fraction is not a fractional number, since it figures out number `5` and this one is not part of a whole. The number `sqrt 2 / 3` is also written as a fraction, but it is not a fractional number since the numerator is not a whole number.</p>
