**Exercise:**

**1. Number Representation:**

*   **a) Convert the decimal number 1234 to its hexadecimal representation.**
*   **b) Convert the hexadecimal number 0xCAFE to its decimal representation.**
*   **c) Perform the following hexadecimal addition: 0x2A + 0x5B.** 
*   **d) Perform the following hexadecimal subtraction: 0x7F - 0x3A.**

**2. Bitwise Operations:**

*   **a) Given the following hexadecimal numbers: A = 0xAB, B = 0xCD.**
      *   Perform the bitwise AND operation (A & B) and express the result in hexadecimal.
      *   Perform the bitwise OR operation (A | B) and express the result in hexadecimal.
      *   Perform the bitwise XOR operation (A ^ B) and express the result in hexadecimal.
      *   Perform the bitwise NOT operation (~A) and express the result in hexadecimal.
*   **b) Explain how you can use bitwise operations to:**
      *   Check if a specific bit in a given hexadecimal number is set to 1.
      *   Set a specific bit in a given hexadecimal number to 1.
      *   Clear a specific bit in a given hexadecimal number to 0.
      *   Toggle the value of a specific bit in a given hexadecimal number.

**3. Applications:**

*   **a) Explain the significance of hexadecimal numbers in computer science, particularly in relation to memory addresses and color representation.**
*   **b) Describe how hexadecimal numbers are used in networking protocols (e.g., MAC addresses, IPv6 addresses).**
*   **c) Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of using hexadecimal notation compared to decimal and binary notation.**

**4. Challenging Problem:**

*   **a) Write a simple algorithm (in pseudocode or using a programming language of your choice) to convert a decimal number to its hexadecimal representation.**

**Solutions (for instructor reference):**

1.  **a) 1234 (decimal) = 0x4D2 (hexadecimal)**
    **b) 0xCAFE (hexadecimal) = 51966 (decimal)**
    **c) 0x2A + 0x5B = 0x85**
    **d) 0x7F - 0x3A = 0x45**
2.  **a)**
      *   A & B = 0x89
      *   A | B = 0xCF
      *   A ^ B = 0x46
      *   ~A = 0x54
3.  **a)**
      *   **Memory Addresses:** Hexadecimal is often used for memory addresses due to its compact representation and ease of conversion to binary.
      *   **Color Representation:** Colors are often represented in hexadecimal using RGB or RGBA values (e.g., #FFFFFF for white).
4.  **a)**
      *   **Algorithm (Pseudocode):**
          ```
          function decimalToHexadecimal(decimal):
              hexadecimal = "" 
              while decimal > 0:
                  remainder = decimal % 16
                  if remainder < 10:
                      hexadecimal = str(remainder) + hexadecimal 
                  else:
                      hexadecimal = chr(ord('A') + remainder - 10) + hexadecimal 
                  decimal = decimal // 16
              return hexadecimal 
          ```

**Key Considerations:**

*   **Difficulty:** Adjust the difficulty by including more complex conversions, bitwise operations, or application-based problems.
*   **Programming:** If students have programming experience, incorporate programming exercises that involve hexadecimal manipulation.
*   **Real-world Examples:** Use real-world examples to illustrate the concepts and motivate students (e.g., analyzing network traffic, debugging assembly code).

This exercise covers fundamental concepts of hexadecimal numbers, their applications in computer science, and basic bitwise operations. It provides a solid foundation for students to understand and work with hexadecimal numbers effectively in their computer science studies.
