**Worked Exercise: Octal Numbers**

**1. Conversion Between Decimal and Octal**

*   **a) Convert the decimal number 153 to its octal representation.**

    *   **Solution:**
        1. Divide 153 by 8 repeatedly:
           - 153 ÷ 8 = 19 with a remainder of 1
           - 19 ÷ 8 = 2 with a remainder of 3
           - 2 ÷ 8 = 0 with a remainder of 2
        2. Read the remainders from bottom to top: 231
        *   **Therefore, 153 (decimal) = 231 (octal)**

*   **b) Convert the octal number 472 to its decimal representation.**

    *   **Solution:**
        1. Expand the octal number using its place values:
           472 (octal) = (4 × 8²) + (7 × 8¹) + (2 × 8⁰)
        2. Calculate:
           472 (octal) = (4 × 64) + (7 × 8) + (2 × 1) = 256 + 56 + 2 = 314
        *   **Therefore, 472 (octal) = 314 (decimal)**

**2. Octal Arithmetic**

*   **a) Perform the following octal addition: 37 + 52**

    *   **Solution:**
        ```
          37
        + 52
        -----
          111
        ```

*   **b) Perform the following octal subtraction: 75 - 26**

    *   **Solution:**
        ```
          75
        - 26
        -----
          47
        ```

**3. Octal to Binary Conversion**

*   **a) Convert the octal number 613 to its binary representation.**

    *   **Solution:**
        1. Convert each octal digit to its 3-bit binary equivalent:
           - 6 (octal) = 110 (binary)
           - 1 (octal) = 001 (binary)
           - 3 (octal) = 011 (binary)
        2. Combine the binary equivalents: 110 001 011
        *   **Therefore, 613 (octal) = 110001011 (binary)**

**4. Binary to Octal Conversion**

*   **a) Convert the binary number 101110 to its octal representation.**

    *   **Solution:**
        1. Group the binary digits into groups of three, starting from the right: 1 011 110
        2. Convert each group of three binary digits to its octal equivalent:
           - 1 (binary) = 1 (octal)
           - 011 (binary) = 3 (octal)
           - 110 (binary) = 6 (octal)
        *   **Therefore, 101110 (binary) = 136 (octal)**

**5. Application: File Permissions**

*   Octal numbers are often used to represent file permissions in Unix-like systems. Each permission (read, write, execute) for owner, group, and others is represented by a single octal digit.

**Note:** These are basic exercises. For more advanced problems, you can explore octal-to-hexadecimal conversions, bitwise operations on octal numbers, and real-world applications in computer systems.
