### Set theory


<h5> Fundamentals </h5>

* A Set is a collection of distinct and defined elements. 
* Sets are represented by using French braces $\{ \}$ with commas to separate the elements in a Set.

<h5> Cardinality </h5>

* The number of distinct elements in a finite set is called its cardinality.




### Set Theory Operations

*  The Universal Set $\mathcal{U}$

### Set Specification



<h5> NOTATIONS FOR A SET: </h5>

A set can be represented by two methods:
1.	ROSTER METHOD
2.	BUILDER METHOD


<h5> ROSTER METHOD: </h5>

In this method the elements of a set are separated by commas and are enclosed within curly brackets { }. For example:

* A = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6} is a set of numbers.

* B = {Alex, Brian, Collenn, Darren, Elizabeth} is a set of names.

* C = {a, e, i, o, u} is a set of vowels.

* D = {apple, avocado, orange, banana, pear} is a set of fruits.

Listing the elements in this way is called Roster method. In this method, it is not necessary for the elements to be listed in a particular order. The elements of the set can be written just plainly, separated by commas and in any order.


<h5>  BUILDER METHOD </h5>


This method is also called Property method. In Builder method, a set is represented by stating all the properties which are satisfied by the elements of that particular set only.

For example:

If A is a set of elements less than 0, then in Builder method it will be written as

A = {x: x < 0}, this statement is read as "the set of all x such that x is less than 0"

If A is a set of all real numbers less than 7, then in Builder method it is written as A = {x   R: x < 7}

Similarly,

A = {2i: i is an integer} is a set of all even integers.

A = {x   R: x ? 2} is a set of all real numbers except 2.

A = {x   R: x > 3 and x < 7} is a set of real numbers greater than 3 but less than 7.

A = {x   Z: x > 6} is a set of integers greater than 6.

A = {x   Z: 2x + 1} is a set of all odd integers.

### Set theory

#### Definition of a set

A set is defined completely by its elements. Formally, sets X and Y are the same set if they have the same elements; that is, if every element of X is also an element of Y, and vice versa. For example, suppose we define:

\[ F = \{x | \mbox{(x is an integer)} \mbox{ and } 0 < x < 4)\}  \]

The equivalence of empty sets has a \textbf{\textit{metaphysical}} consequence for some theories of the metaphysics of properties that define the property of being x as simply the set of all x, then if the two properties are uninstantiated or coextensive they are equivalent - under this theory, because there are no unicorns and there are no pixies, the property of being a unicorn and being a pixie are the same - but if there were a unicorns and pixies, we could tell them apart. (See Universals for more on this.)

### Elements and subsets

The $\in$  sign indicates set membership. If x is an element (or "member") of a set X, we write $ \in X$; e.g. $3\in A$. (We may also say ``X contains x" and ``A contains 3")

A very important notion is that of a subset. X is a subset of Y, written $X \subseteq Y$ (sometimes simply as$X \subset Y$), if every element of X is also an element of Y. From before $C\subseteq A \subseteq E$.

#### Sets containing Sets


Sets can of course be elements of other sets; for example we can form the set $G = \{A,B,C,D,E\}$, whose five elements are the sets we considered earlier. Then, for instance, $A\in G$. (Note that this is very different from saying $A\subseteq G$)









### Number Sets

The font that the symbols are written in (i.e. $\mathbb{N}$, $\mathbb{R}$) is known as ***blackboard font***.

*  $\mathbb{N}$ Natural Numbers ($0,1,2,3$) 
(Not used in the CIS102 Syllabus)
*  $\mathbb{Z}$ Integers ($-3,-2,-1,0,1,2,3, \ldots$)
\begin{itemize}
* [$\ast$] $\mathbb{Z}^{+}$ Positive Integers
* [$\ast$] $\mathbb{Z}^{-}$ Negative Integers
\end{itemize}
*  $\mathbb{Q}$ Rational Numbers
*  $\mathbb{R}$ Real Numbers

#### Sets of Numbers

*  $\mathbb{Z}$ Set of all integers
*  $\mathbb{Q}$ Set of all rational numbers
*  $\mathbb{R}$ Set of all real numbers


*  $\mathbb{Z}^{+}$ Set of all positive integers
*  $\mathbb{Z}^{-}$ Set of all negative integers
*  $\mathbb{R}^{+}$ Set of all positive real numbers
*  $\mathbb{R}^{-}$ Set of all negative real numbers

### Power set

The power set of X, $P(X)$, is the set whose elements are all the subsets of X. Thus \[P(A) = \{ \{\}, \{1\}, \{2\}, \{3\}, \{1,2\}, \{1,3\}, \{2,3\}, \{1,2,3\}\}\]. The power set of the empty set $P(\{\})$ = $\{\{\}\}$. 

Note that in both cases the cardinality of the power set is strictly greater than that of base set: No one-to-one correspondence exists between the set and its power set. 




In set theory, the Cartesian product of two sets A and B, denoted A Ã— B, is the set of all ordered pairs (a, b) where a is in A and b is in B.
Cartesian Product is the multiplication of two sets to form the set of all ordered pairs. The first element of the ordered pair belong to first set and second pair belong the second set.
