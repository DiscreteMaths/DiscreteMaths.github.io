### Introduction

In mathematics, a matrix (plural matrices ) is a rectangular array of numbers, symbols, or expressions, arranged in rows and columns. Matrices are commonly written in box brackets.

An $m \times n$ (read ‘m by n’) matrix is an arrangement of numbers (or algebraic expressions ) in $m$ rows and $n$ columns. Each number in a given matrix is called an element or entry. A zero matrix has all its elements equal to zero.

### The Identity Matrix 

The identity matrix or unit matrix of size n is the $n\times n$  square matrix with ones on the main diagonal and zeros elsewhere. It is denoted by $I_n$, or simply by I if the size is immaterial or can be trivially determined by the context. 

\[
I_{1}={\begin{bmatrix}1\end{bmatrix}},\ I_{2}={\begin{bmatrix}1&0\\0&1\end{bmatrix}},\ I_{3}={\begin{bmatrix}1&0&0\\0&1&0\\0&0&1\end{bmatrix}},\ \cdots ,\ I_{n}={\begin{bmatrix}1&0&\cdots &0\\0&1&\cdots &0\\\vdots &\vdots &\ddots &\vdots \\0&0&\cdots &1\end{bmatrix}}
\]

* When A is a square matrix (i.e. $n\times n$), it is a property of matrix multiplication that
\[I_{N}A=AI_{n}=A.\,\]

* When A is $m\times n$, it is a property of matrix multiplication that
\[I_{m}A=AI_{n}=A.\,\]

* The Identity matrix itself is invertible, being its own inverse.

* The Identity matrix is symmetrix, which is to say, it is it's own tranpose.


### Adding and Substracting Matrices


### Matrix Multiplication

* Method for multiply a pair of $2\times2$ matrices.

\[ \left(
\begin{array}{cc}
a_1 & a_2 \\ 
b_1 & b_2
\end{array} \right)\left(
\begin{array}{cc}
c_1 & d_1 \\ 
c_2 & d_2
\end{array} \right) = \left(
\begin{array}{cc}
(a_1 \times c_1) + (a_2 \times c_2) & (a_1 \times d_1) + (a_2 \times d_2) \\ 
(b_1 \times c_1) + (b_2 \times c_2) & (b_1 \times d_1) + (b_2 \times d_2)
\end{array} \right) \]

#### Example

\[ \left(
\begin{array}{cc}
1 & 3 \\ 
0 & 2
\end{array} \right)\left(
\begin{array}{cc}
1 & 2 \\ 
4 & 1
\end{array} \right) = \left(
\begin{array}{cc}
(1 \times 1) + (3 \times 4) & (1 \times 2) + (3 \times 1) \\ 
(0 \times 4) + (2 \times 4) & (0 \times 2) + (2 \times 1)
\end{array} \right) = \left(
\begin{array}{cc}
14 & 5 \\ 
8 & 2
\end{array} \right) \]


### Determinants


The determinant helps us find the inverse of a matrix, tells us things about the matrix that are useful in systems of linear equations, calculus and more.

The symbol for determinant is two vertical lines either side: |A| means the determinant of the matrix A (exactly the same symbol as absolute value.)

In the case of a 2 × 2 matrix the determinant can be defined as

$${\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}|A|={\begin{vmatrix}a&b\\c&d\end{vmatrix}}=ad-bc.\end{aligned}}}$$
Similarly, for a 3 × 3 matrix A, its determinant is

$${\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}|A|={\begin{vmatrix}a&b&c\\d&e&f\\g&h&i\end{vmatrix}}&=a\,{\begin{vmatrix}e&f\\h&i\end{vmatrix}}-b\,{\begin{vmatrix}d&f\\g&i\end{vmatrix}}+c\,{\begin{vmatrix}d&e\\g&h\end{vmatrix}}\\[3pt]&=aei+bfg+cdh-ceg-bdi-afh.\end{aligned}}}$$

#### Determinant of a $3 \times 3$ matrix
\[ |A| = a_{11} \left|\begin{array}{cc}
a_{22} & a_{23} \\
a_{32} & a_{33} \\
\end{array}  right| - a_{12} \left| \begin{array}{cc}
a_{21} & a_{23} \\
a_{31} & a_{33} \\
\end{array} right| + a_{13} \left|\begin{array}{cc}
a_{21} & a_{22} \\
a_{31} & a_{32} \\
\end{array}  right| \]



### Reduced Row Echelon Form

Specifically, a matrix is in row echelon form if

* All nonzero rows (rows with at least one nonzero element) are above any rows of all zeroes (all zero rows, if any, belong at the bottom of the matrix).
* The leading coefficient (the first nonzero number from the left, also called the pivot) of a nonzero row is always strictly to the right of the leading coefficient of the row above it.
* All entries in a column below a leading entry are zeroes (implied by the first two criteria).[1]

\[\left[ \begin{array}{ccccc}
1 & a_0 & a_1 & a_2 & a_3 \\
0 & 0 & 1 & a_4 & a_5 \\
0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & a_6
\end{array} \right]\]


### Fundamental Theorem of Linear Algebra

* The rank of a matrix is $n$.
* The determinant of the matrix is not zero.
* The matrix is invertible.
* The rows are linearly independent
* There exists a solution to a set of Linear equation based on the matrix
