To prove that if \((X \cup Y) \subseteq (X \cap Y)\), then \(X = Y\), let's use the laws of set theory and logical reasoning.

### Proof:
1. **Given**: \((X \cup Y) \subseteq (X \cap Y)\).

2. **Subset Definition**: If \(A \subseteq B\), then every element of \(A\) is also an element of \(B\).

3. **Apply to Given**: If \((X \cup Y) \subseteq (X \cap Y)\), then every element in \((X \cup Y)\) must also be in \((X \cap Y)\).

4. **Element in Union**: Let \(a\) be any element in \((X \cup Y)\). Then \(a \in X \cup Y\) means \(a \in X\) or \(a \in Y\).

5. **Element in Intersection**: Since \(a \in (X \cup Y)\) and \((X \cup Y) \subseteq (X \cap Y)\), \(a\) must also be in \((X \cap Y)\). Therefore, \(a \in X\) and \(a \in Y\).

6. **Conclusion from Intersection**: For \(a\) to be in \((X \cap Y)\), it must be true that \(a\) is in both \(X\) and \(Y\).

7. **Equality of Sets**: Since every element \(a\) that is in \(X \cup Y\) (which includes all elements in \(X\) and all elements in \(Y\)) is also in both \(X\) and \(Y\), we conclude that every element of \(X\) is in \(Y\) and every element of \(Y\) is in \(X\).

8. **Sets are Equal**: Therefore, \(X = Y\).

### Summary:
If \((X \cup Y) \subseteq (X \cap Y)\), then every element of \(X\) is in \(Y\) and vice versa, which implies that the sets \(X\) and \(Y\) are equal.

This concludes the proof that \((X \cup Y) \subseteq (X \cap Y)\) implies \(X = Y\). If you need further clarification or have more questions, feel free to ask!
