### Digraphs

A directed graph, or **digraph**, is a type of graph in which edges have a direction, indicating a one-way relationship between two vertices. Each edge in a digraph is represented as an ordered pair \( (u, v) \), where the direction is from vertex \( u \) to vertex \( v \). This contrasts with undirected graphs, where edges do not have a direction.

### Key Features of Digraphs:
- **Vertices**: The nodes or points in the graph.
- **Edges**: Directed connections between vertices, also known as arcs.
- **In-degree**: The number of edges coming into a vertex.
- **Out-degree**: The number of edges going out from a vertex.

### Applications:
- **Traffic Networks**: Modeling one-way streets and traffic flow.
- **Social Networks**: Representing follower-followee relationships.
- **Web Graphs**: Analyzing web page links and website structure.
- **Task Scheduling**: Depicting dependencies between tasks in project management.

Digraphs are essential in various fields such as computer science, engineering, and operations research, providing a powerful framework for modeling and analyzing directed relationships and processes.
