To represent the pecking order among the chickens at Home Farm, we can create a directed graph (digraph) where each chicken is a vertex, and a directed edge from chicken \(x\) to chicken \(y\) indicates that \(x\) is dominant over \(y\).

### Pecking Order Digraph
Here are the vertices and edges based on the given dominance relations:

- **Vertices**: Amy (A), Beth (B), Carol (C), Daisy (D), Eve (E)

- **Edges**:
  - A -> B
  - A -> C
  - B -> E
  - B -> C
  - C -> E
  - C -> D
  - D -> E
  - D -> A
  - D -> B
  - E -> A

### Adjacency List Representation:
```
A: B, C
B: E, C
C: E, D
D: E, A, B
E: A
```

### Adjacency Matrix Representation:
```
    A B C D E
A [ 0 1 1 0 0 ]
B [ 0 0 1 0 1 ]
C [ 0 0 0 1 1 ]
D [ 1 1 0 0 1 ]
E [ 1 0 0 0 0 ]
```

In this digraph:
- **Vertex A** (Amy) has outgoing edges to B (Beth) and C (Carol), indicating Amy is dominant over Beth and Carol.
- **Vertex B** (Beth) has outgoing edges to E (Eve) and C (Carol), indicating Beth is dominant over Eve and Carol.
- **Vertex C** (Carol) has outgoing edges to E (Eve) and D (Daisy), indicating Carol is dominant over Eve and Daisy.
- **Vertex D** (Daisy) has outgoing edges to E (Eve), A (Amy), and B (Beth), indicating Daisy is dominant over Eve, Amy, and Beth.
- **Vertex E** (Eve) has an outgoing edge to A (Amy), indicating Eve is dominant over Amy.

This digraph effectively represents the pecking order among the chickens at Home Farm. If you have any more questions or need further analysis, feel free to ask!
