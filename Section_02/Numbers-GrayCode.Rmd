### Gray Code

#### Gray Code


* The reflected binary code (RBC), also known just as reflected binary (RB) or Gray code after Frank Gray, is an ordering of the binary numeral system such that two successive values differ in only one bit (binary digit).

* For example, the representation of the decimal value "1" in binary would normally be "001" and "2" would be "010". 

* In Gray code, these values are represented as "001" and "011". That way, incrementing a value from 1 to 2 requires only one bit to change, instead of two.

* Gray codes are widely used to prevent spurious output from electromechanical switches and to facilitate error correction in digital communications such as digital terrestrial television and some cable TV systems. 

### Worked Example

Here is an example of generating Gray code, which is a binary numeral system where two successive values differ in only one bit.

<h3> Example: Generate 3-bit Gray Code</h3>

#### Step 1: Understand Binary Representation
First, list all the 3-bit binary numbers in standard order:
```
000, 001, 010, 011, 100, 101, 110, 111
```

#### Step 2: Generate Gray Code
To convert these binary numbers to Gray code, follow the rule where the first bit remains the same, and each subsequent bit is obtained by XOR'ing the previous bit with the current bit.

Let's go through each binary number:

1. **000** (Binary)
   
- First bit remains the same: **0**
   
- Second bit: \(0 \oplus 0 = 0\)
   
- Third bit: \(0 \oplus 0 = 0\)
   
- Gray code: **000**

2. **001** (Binary)
   
- First bit remains the same: **0**
   
- Second bit: \(0 \oplus 0 = 0\)
   
- Third bit: \(0 \oplus 1 = 1\)
   
- Gray code: **001**

3. **010** (Binary)
   
- First bit remains the same: **0**
   
- Second bit: \(0 \oplus 1 = 1\)
   
- Third bit: \(1 \oplus 0 = 1\)
   
- Gray code: **011**

4. **011** (Binary)
   
- First bit remains the same: **0**
   
- Second bit: \(0 \oplus 1 = 1\)
   
- Third bit: \(1 \oplus 1 = 0\)
   
- Gray code: **010**

5. **100** (Binary)
   
- First bit remains the same: **1**
   
- Second bit: \(1 \oplus 0 = 1\)
   
- Third bit: \(1 \oplus 0 = 1\)
   
- Gray code: **110**

6. **101** (Binary)
   
- First bit remains the same: **1**
   
- Second bit: \(1 \oplus 0 = 1\)
   
- Third bit: \(1 \oplus 1 = 0\)
   
- Gray code: **111**

7. **110** (Binary)
   
- First bit remains the same: **1**
   
- Second bit: \(1 \oplus 1 = 0\)
   
- Third bit: \(0 \oplus 1 = 1\)
   
- Gray code: **101**

8. **111** (Binary)
   
- First bit remains the same: **1**
   
- Second bit: \(1 \oplus 1 = 0\)
   
- Third bit: \(0 \oplus 1 = 1\)
   
- Gray code: **100**

#### Step 3: List the Gray Code Sequence
Here is the 3-bit Gray code sequence:
```
000, 001, 011, 010, 110, 111, 101, 100
```

#### Summary
By following the rule of keeping the first bit the same and XOR'ing subsequent bits, we have successfully converted 3-bit binary numbers into Gray code. This sequence ensures that only one bit changes between consecutive values.
