### Hexadecimal Numbers

<h5> Hexadecimal Numbers </h5>

* The hexadecimal numeral system, often shortened to "hex", is a numeral system made up of 16 symbols (base 16). The standard numeral system is called decimal (base 10) and uses ten symbols: 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9. 

* Hexadecimal uses the decimal numbers and six extra symbols. There are no numerical symbols that represent values greater than nine, so letters taken from the English alphabet are used, specifically A, B, C, D, E and F. Hexadecimal A = decimal 10, and hexadecimal F = decimal 15.

* To avoid confusion with decimal, octal or other numbering systems, hexadecimal numbers are sometimes written with a "h" after or "0x" before the number. For example, 63h and 0x63 mean 63 hexadecimal.


### Octal Numbers


<h5> Octal Numbers </h5>

* The octal numeral system, or oct for short, is the base-8 number system, and uses the digits 0 to 7.
* Octal numerals can be made from binary numerals by grouping consecutive binary digits into groups of three (starting from the right). 
* For example, the binary representation for decimal 74 is 1001010.
