### Hexadecimal Numbers

#### Introduction to Hexadecimal Numbers
Hexadecimal (or simply "hex") is a base-16 number system. It uses 16 distinct symbols: the digits 0-9 and the letters A-F, where A stands for 10, B for 11, C for 12, D for 13, E for 14, and F for 15. Hexadecimal is often used in computing and digital electronics because it can represent large binary numbers more compactly.

#### Why Use Hexadecimal?
- **Compact Representation**: Hexadecimal representation is more compact compared to binary, reducing the length of numbers.
- **Ease of Conversion**: It's easy to convert between binary and hexadecimal. Each hex digit corresponds to four binary digits (bits).
- **Human-Friendly**: Hexadecimal is more readable and manageable for humans compared to long strings of binary digits.

#### Hexadecimal Number System
- **Base**: 16
- **Symbols**: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, A, B, C, D, E, F

#### Converting Between Binary and Hexadecimal
To convert a binary number to hexadecimal, group the binary digits into sets of four (starting from the right). Each group of four binary digits corresponds to a single hexadecimal digit.

### Examples

**Example 1: Convert Binary to Hexadecimal**
Binary number: `101101101010`
1. Group the binary digits into sets of four: `1011 0110 1010`
2. Convert each group to hexadecimal:
   - `1011` = `B`
   - `0110` = `6`
   - `1010` = `A`
3. So, `101101101010` in binary is `B6A` in hexadecimal.

**Example 2: Convert Hexadecimal to Binary**
Hexadecimal number: `4F3`
1. Convert each hex digit to its binary equivalent:
   - `4` = `0100`
   - `F` = `1111`
   - `3` = `0011`
2. Combine the binary groups: `0100 1111 0011`
3. So, `4F3` in hexadecimal is `010011110011` in binary.

#### Converting Between Decimal and Hexadecimal
To convert a decimal number to hexadecimal, repeatedly divide the number by 16 and keep track of the remainders. The hexadecimal number is obtained by reading the remainders in reverse order.

**Example 3: Convert Decimal to Hexadecimal**
Decimal number: `254`
1. Divide by 16: \( 254 \div 16 = 15 \) remainder \( 14 \) (E)
2. Divide the quotient by 16: \( 15 \div 16 = 0 \) remainder \( 15 \) (F)
3. So, `254` in decimal is `FE` in hexadecimal.

**Example 4: Convert Hexadecimal to Decimal**
Hexadecimal number: `1A3`
1. Convert each hex digit to decimal and multiply by the corresponding power of 16:
   - `1` = 1 \(\times 16^2 = 256\)
   - `A` = 10 \(\times 16^1 = 160\)
   - `3` = 3 \(\times 16^0 = 3\)
2. Sum the results: \( 256 + 160 + 3 = 419 \)
3. So, `1A3` in hexadecimal is `419` in decimal.

#### Practical Uses of Hexadecimal
- **Memory Addresses**: Hexadecimal is often used to represent memory addresses in programming and debugging.
- **Color Codes**: In web design, colors are often specified using hexadecimal values (e.g., `#FFFFFF` for white).
- **File Formats**: Hexadecimal is used in various file formats and protocols for compact data representation.

#### Exercises
1. Convert the binary number `110101011` to hexadecimal.
2. Convert the hexadecimal number `3C9` to binary.
3. Convert the decimal number `456` to hexadecimal.
4. Convert the hexadecimal number `2F` to decimal.


### Summary

<h5> Hexadecimal Numbers </h5>

* The hexadecimal numeral system, often shortened to "hex", is a numeral system made up of 16 symbols (base 16). The standard numeral system is called decimal (base 10) and uses ten symbols: 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9. 

* Hexadecimal uses the decimal numbers and six extra symbols. There are no numerical symbols that represent values greater than nine, so letters taken from the English alphabet are used, specifically A, B, C, D, E and F. Hexadecimal A = decimal 10, and hexadecimal F = decimal 15.

* To avoid confusion with decimal, octal or other numbering systems, hexadecimal numbers are sometimes written with a "h" after or "0x" before the number. For example, 63h and 0x63 mean 63 hexadecimal.
