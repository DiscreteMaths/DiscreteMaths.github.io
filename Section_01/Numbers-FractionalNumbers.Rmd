### Fractional Numbers 


A **fractional number**, commonly referred to as a **fraction**, represents a part of a whole or a ratio between two quantities. It consists of two components: a **numerator** and a **denominator**.

#### Components:
- **Numerator**: The top part of the fraction, indicating how many parts of the whole are being considered.
- **Denominator**: The bottom part of the fraction, indicating the total number of equal parts that make up the whole.

#### Examples:
- \( \frac{1}{2} \): Represents one half of a whole.
- \( \frac{3}{4} \): Represents three parts out of four equal parts of a whole.

#### Types of Fractions:
- **Proper Fractions**: The numerator is less than the denominator (e.g., \( \frac{3}{7} \)).
- **Improper Fractions**: The numerator is greater than or equal to the denominator (e.g., \( \frac{5}{3} \)).
- **Mixed Numbers**: A combination of a whole number and a proper fraction (e.g., \( 2 \frac{1}{2} \)).

#### Operations with Fractions:
- **Addition/Subtraction**: Fractions are added or subtracted by finding a common denominator.
- **Multiplication**: Fractions are multiplied by multiplying the numerators together and the denominators together.
- **Division**: Dividing one fraction by another involves multiplying by the reciprocal of the second fraction.

#### Importance:
Fractions are essential in various fields, including mathematics, science, engineering, and everyday life, for representing and manipulating quantities that are not whole numbers.
