### Repeating Decimals

<h4> Repeating Decimals</h4>


A **repeating decimal** (or **recurring decimal**) is a decimal number that has a sequence of digits that repeats infinitely. The repeating part of the decimal can be a single digit or a group of digits. In mathematical notation, repeating decimals are often represented by placing a bar (vinculum) over the repeating digits.

#### Examples:
1. **Single Digit Repeating**:
   - \( \frac{1}{3} \) is represented as \( 0.\overline{3} \), which means \( 0.3333\ldots \) (with 3 repeating indefinitely).

2. **Multiple Digits Repeating**:
   - \( \frac{1}{7} \) is represented as \( 0.\overline{142857} \), which means \( 0.142857142857\ldots \) (with the digits 142857 repeating indefinitely).

#### Characteristics:
- **Periodic Sequence**: The repeating sequence (period) occurs after a certain number of digits.
- **Rational Numbers**: Every repeating decimal represents a rational number (a fraction of two integers).

#### Converting a Repeating Decimal to a Fraction:
To convert a repeating decimal to a fraction, algebraic methods are often used. Here's a step-by-step example for converting \( 0.\overline{6} \) to a fraction:

1. Let \( x = 0.\overline{6} \).
2. Multiply both sides by 10 to shift the decimal point: \( 10x = 6.\overline{6} \).
3. Subtract the original equation from this new equation: \( 10x - x = 6.\overline{6} - 0.\overline{6} \).
4. Simplify the equation: \( 9x = 6 \).
5. Solve for \( x \): \( x = \frac{6}{9} = \frac{2}{3} \).

So, \( 0.\overline{6} \) is equivalent to the fraction \( \frac{2}{3} \).

#### Importance:
Repeating decimals are crucial in understanding the relationship between rational numbers and their decimal representations. They also appear frequently in calculations and real-world applications, making their understanding essential for mathematical literacy.

A repeating decimal, also called a recurring decimal, is a number whose decimal representation eventually becomes periodic (i.e., the same sequence of digits repeats indefinitely). The repeating portion of a decimal expansion is conventionally denoted with a ***vinculum*** so, for example,

$$ 1‚ÅÑ7 = 0.\overline{142857} = 0.1428571428571428571...$$

The minimum number of digits that repeats in such a number is known as the decimal period.
